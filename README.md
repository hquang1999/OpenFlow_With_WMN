# OpenFlow With WMN
This repository is for the research of implementing openflow capabilities on top of wireless mesh networks.

The current openflow implementation is on Open VSwitch.
The current WMN implementation is on BATMAN.

1. If you only care about the wireless mesh networking portion, read the BATMAN_Doucmentation in Documentation.

2. If you only care about the SDN portion, read the OpenVSwichDoucmentation and RYU_Controller in Documentation.

3. If you want to implement both, read 1. then 2. documentation.
